// ## 1. Earthquake

// ### Task

// The table below contains earthquake magnitude ranges on the Richter scale and their descriptors.
//  Write a program that reads a magnitude from the user and displays the appropriate descriptor as part of a meaningful message. 
//  For example, if the user enters 5.5 then your program should indicate that a magnitude 5.5 earthquake is considered to be a moderate earthquake.

// | Magnitude             | Descriptor |
// | ----------------------| -----------|
// | Less than 2.0         | Mirco      |
// | 2.0 to less than 3.0  | Very Minor |
// | 3.0 to less than 4.0  | Minor      |
// | 4.0 to less than 5.0  | Light      |
// | 5.0 to less than 6.0  | Moderate   |
// | 6.0 to less than 7.0  | Strong     |
// | 7.0 to less than 8.0  | Major      |
// | 8.0 to less than 10.0 | Great      |
// | More than 10.0        | Meteoric   |

// ### Key Concepts
// Data types, variables, selection statements (if or switch)
