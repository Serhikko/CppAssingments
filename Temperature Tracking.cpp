// Task

// Design a program that helps track daily temperatures for a week. The program should:

//     Prompt the user to enter the temperature for each day of the week and store these into an array
//     Calculate and display the average temperature for the entire week
//     Identify and display how many days has a temperature above 25 degrees and output an appropriate message

// Key Concepts
// Iteration (for or while), Arrays


//declare int days
//declare double temperature
//declare sum
//
//make an array to store 7 temperatures
//
//prompt user to type temperatures in that array
//
//make sum of those temperatures
//
//calculate avarage temp deviding sum/days
//
//cout output results
//
//if daysabove25 ==0 cout 0 days were hotter than 25 degrees
//if daysAbove25 == days cout 7 days were hotter than 25 degrees
//else some days were hotter than 25
//
//return 0
